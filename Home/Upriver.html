<p> As you make your way upriver towards the sound you hear another crunch. You lock eyes with a fawn, and it doesn’t seem to fear you. It laps up some water and slowly sets off upstream with the confidence and surefootedness you would expect more from a mature deer. You follow her further and further into the woods, a quiet sense of calm growing in you. 

	<br><br> 


You come into a clearing and are greeted by the fawn's family, four more fawns, a doe, and a buck. You see a well and a small house that is in surprisingly good condition. “How am I supposed to get home now?” you ask yourself out loud. The fawn looks up at you and says “You are home now” in a high singsong voice. 

	<br><br> 


Something in the back of your mind tells you that something is off, it's odd that a deer so young can speak. You have a vague sense that there is another home, a place very different from this, but the harder you try to remember it the more it escapes you. You walk into the house, picking a sweet berry from a bush growing under one of the windows. “Home” you think to yourself with a smile as you settle into the house. </p>
