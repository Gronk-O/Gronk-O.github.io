<p> You make your way through brush and branches, your skin crawls as the foliage tickles your calves and images of spiders and unnamed insects flash through your mind. At last, you emerge into overgrown clearing around the cabin. As you draw closer you spot the rather tamed circle of grass in front of the entrance to the cabin. 


	<br><br> 

You take a pause, it’s a perfect circle, as if someone has been mowing and tending to this patch. “Maybe someone lives here!” you think to yourself, excited at the prospect of help (and possibly a shower). The door is ajar, and you notice the fox sitting unperturbed at the door. It looks back at you with an unusual intelligence, maybe even curiosity. 


	<br><br> 

It reminds you of your dog, Rocky, a bit, who looks something like a red fox himself. The fox stands up and looks at you as he turns around before slipping into the cabin. Aside from the grass, there doesn’t seem to be anyone living there. Do you follow after the fox into the cabin, or do you double back and head for the stream? </p>
