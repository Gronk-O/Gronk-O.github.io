<p> You step out into the manicured grass and your anxiety begins to lessen. Your newfound peace grows with every step towards the entryway. As your hand meets the door it swings open, almost eagerly. Something feels oddly familiar about this place, as if you’ve been here in a dream. You hear the clatter of silverware hitting the ground, drawing your attention to the kitchen. 


	<br><br> 


“There he is” you think in relief. Your fox is safe at home and probably hungry. You cross the room over to your kitchen and grab some of the rabbit jerky from the jar in the top left cabinet. Rocky strolls over and eats the jerky from your hands, “good boy” you murmur, wasn’t there something else you were supposed to be doing? There was somewhere you had to be... or did you just come back from that destination? I suppose if you can't remember, I mustn't be that important. Rocky rubs his face into your hand and you pet him reflexively. You’re tired. You pick up Rocky and go lay down on the couch. Your memory is hazy, but you feel you’ve had a long day and so you settle in for a nap. </p>
