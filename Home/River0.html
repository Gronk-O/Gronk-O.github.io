<p> You walk up to the river, it’s gentle babbling offers a small sense of comfort. You pause, enchantched, to admire the impossible clarity of the water as tiny silver and brown fish swim by, glistening in the spots of sunlight breaking through the cover.  You hear the crunching of twigs about 10 meters behind you. “Nope” you think to yourself, snapping out of the river’s trance, and begin your march downriver. “Walking towards the noise is how people get killed in horror movies” you think to yourself, a bit nervous realizing how tempted you had been to investigate. 


	<br><br> 

As you continue your trek you begin to hear the music of songbirds and the humming of insects, making you realize just how unusually quiet the area you came from was. You stop. Out of the corner of your eye you spot a familiar scene. A tin of mints, a water bottle, and keys. Your keys. You dig your hands in your pockets and pull out your keys, with the same 1988 summer Olympics keychain your grandmother gave you that is also not 5 meters away from you. You pick up your pace, another pile, then another. You keep speeding up until you’re running. 


	<br><br> 

Wait. Was that music you just heard? You hear the sound of cars zipping by, and your heartbeat quickens. You run towards the traffic and emerge onto a road and the feeling of a weight being lifted comes over you. Washington license plates... You can figure out how you wound up a state away from home later. A woman in a little blue pickup truck spots you waving for help and pulls over. You get in and try to explain the absolute surreal experience that was your day, and while she doesn’t really understand your story, she expresses genuine sympathy. 


	<br><br> 

She takes you to a nearby train station and gives you the train fare. The last leg of your journey is uneventful, you’re out of the woods now. You make it back to your little old studio in Portland and go to bed in your own bed. You have strange dreams, but when you wake up, your blanket is wrapped around you as it should be. </p>
